## What is Unit Testing?

Like any other type of automated testing, unit testing is a means of letting software provide your project with a level of confidence that it is doing what it was designed to do, in a manner that is complete and accurate. It is, essentially, a piece of code that validates another piece of code (that you - or somebody else - wrote) auto-magically, so you don't have to do the same old, tedious, boring thing over and over... and over... and over... and over again, for all eternity... so you can concentrate on what truly matters: Insta cat vidz!

* Am I working in a team, currently or in the foreseeable future?
* Do I care about code quality?
* Do I want my application / project to succeed?
* Do I have Alex as a team / community lead?
